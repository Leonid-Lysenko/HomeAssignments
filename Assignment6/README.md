# A partial specialization of this template class was created for int (the foo method always returns true) and double (the foo method always returns flase).
# Three classes were created for testing:
# Class1::bar returns true if the first parameter is greater than 0
# Class2::bar returns true if the second parameter is a reference to a non-empty vector
# Class3::bar returns true if the first parameter contains the length of the second, multiplied by -1.
# In addition to bar, each class contains the methods int c_i_1(), float c_i_2(), void c_i_3(), where i coincides with the number in the class name.
